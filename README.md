# OS_EAS_Project

Energy Aware Scheduling is a scheduling paradigm that gives the process scheduler the power to
rearrange processes on different CPUs based on energy consumed by the CPUs and processes.
The Linux EAS is implemented to accurately select an energy efficient CPU for each process,
effectively decreasing the energy consumption of a computer system in the process.

To put in simpler words, the EAS paradigm is an energy efficient replacement to the way
the default CFS scheduler of Linux assigns processors to each process. More on how these
processors are assigned and what improvements can be done here to improve the performance of
the computer are analysed in this project.
